HY Full Stack Open course part 12.

**Currently Borked due to WSL/Docker issues**

*Maybe I'll finish this using a linux system at some later point.*

Tasks 12.1 - 12.3 done with `script` command, but the output was so messy that 12.4 was done by copy-pasting.

Task 12.7: Mongo DB docker does not want to start without yml entry 
`volumes:\n  mongo_data:`.

Task 12.7: If using CMD.exe, set dev mongo variable as 
`MONGO_URL=mongodb://the_username:the_password@localhost:3456/the_database npm run dev`.
